## Introduction

Support forward and backward fourier transformation. We usually use the following subroutines to perform fourier transformation for the Green's function.

## Type

subroutines

## Source

`src/s_fourier.f90`

## Usage

(1) Forward FFT, from ``G(\tau) \to G(i\omega_n)``.

```fortran
subroutine s_fft_forward(ntime, tmesh, ftau, mfreq, rmesh, fmat)
```

(2) Backward FFT, from ``G(i\omega_n) \to G(\tau)``.

```fortran
subroutine s_fft_backward(mfreq, rmesh, fmat, ntime, tmesh, ftau, beta)
```

Here, `ntime` is number of imaginary time points, `tmesh` means ``\tau``, `ftau` means ``G(\tau)``, `mfreq` is number of Matsubara frequency points, `rmesh` means ``\omega_n``, `fmat` means ``G(i\omega_n)``, `beta` means inverse temperature of system ``\beta``.

!!! note

    The `s_fft_tails()` subroutine is called by the `s_fft_backward()` subroutine internally. DO NOT call it directly!
