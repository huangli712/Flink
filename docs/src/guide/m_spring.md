# Pseudorandom number generator

The following two random number generators (generates a random number between 0 and 1, real double precision) are supported by now.

## Type

module

## Source

`src/m_spring.f90`

## Usage

**(1)** Use MT19937.

```fortran
use spring
call spring_mt_init(seed)
r = spring_mt_stream()
r = spring_mt_string()
```

**(2)** Use SFMT.

```fortran
use spring
call spring_sfmt_init(seed)
r = spring_sfmt_stream()
r = spring_sfmt_string()
```

The functions `spring_mt_stream()` and `sprint_sfmt_stream()` obtain a psuedo random real number in the range (0,1), i.e., a number
greater than 0 and less than 1. The functions `spring_mt_string()` and `sprint_sfmt_string()` obtain a psuedo random real number in the range [0,1], i.e., a number greater than or equal to 0 and less than or equal to 1.

!!! note

    Since SFMT has a better performance, it is preferable.
