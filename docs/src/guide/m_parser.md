## Introduction

The original input file format for *iQIST* is not very good. We need a flexible, convenient, and powerful input file format, and corresponding file reader and parser. Thus, we redesign the input file format and implement this file parser.

!!! note

    This module depends on the `linkedlist` module internally.

## Type

module

## Source

`src/m_parser.f90`

## Input File Format

(1) Anything after "#" and "!" character can be treated as comments and will be ignored completely.

Example:

```text
   # this is a comment line
   ! this is a comment line

   nband = 4 # this is in line comment
   norbs = 8 ! this is in line comment
```

(2) It is not case sensitive.

Example:

```text
   Nband = 4
   NORBS = 8
   NspiN = 2
```

(3) The key and value pair is separated by "=" or ":" character.

Example:

```text
   nband = 4 ! you can use nband : 4
   norbs : 8 ! you can use norbs = 8
```

(4) Any space will be ignored. Any blank lines will be skipped as well.

Example:

```text
   n b a n d = 4 ! it is valid
   no   rb s = 8 ! it is valid
```

(5) You can only use one line to define one key-value pair.

Example:

```text
   nband = 4 norbs = 8  ! it is not valid
   nband = 4, norbs = 8 ! it is not valid
   nband = 4; norbs = 8 ! it is not valid
   nband =              !
   4                    ! it is not valid
```

(6) In the value part, now only `integer`, `real(dp)`, `logical`, and `character` data type are support.

Example:

```text
   nband = 4        ! integer type
   mune  = 4.0      ! real(dp) type
   isscf = .true.   ! logical type, you can also use .false., T, F
   model = anderson ! character type, do not use "" or '' characters to quote it
```

(7) In the value part, a vector is also support. the items in the vector should be separated by "," character.

Example:

```text
   nband = 1, 2, 3, 4                   ! 4 items
   mune = 0.0, -1.0, 2.0                ! 3 items
   isscf = .true., .true., F, T, .true. ! 5 items
   model = anderson, hubbard            ! 2 items
```

(8) An empty input file is acceptable.

(9) If one key occurs in the input file for more than 1 times, only the last occurrence is recognized.

## Usage

(1) Import parser module support.

```fortran
use parser
```

(2) Create instance for parser.

```fortran
call p_create()
```

(3) Parse the input file.

```fortran
call p_parse(file_name)
```

!!! warning

    In the mpi environment, only the master node can execute this command. You should broadcast the data manually.

(4) Extract parameters.

```fortran
integer :: nband = 2            ! default value
real(dp) :: mune = 10.0_dp      ! default value
logical :: symm(2)              ! default value
symm(1) = .true.
symm(2) = .false.
call p_get('nband', nband)      ! get single value
call p_get('mune', mune)        ! get single value
call p_get_vec('symm', symm, 2) ! get array
```

!!! note

    That if the desired parameter is not contained in the config file, then the default value will not be changed.

    In the mpi environment, only the master node can execute these commands.

    The parser **DO NOT** check the correctness (including number of values, key's name, and datatype of value) of the input file. So, please always monitor the output of ctqmc code which use this parser to parse the input file.

(5) Destroy parser.

```fortran
call p_destroy()
```

(6) Broadcast the parameters read from input file.

Do not forget to broadcast all of the parameters from master node to children nodes.
